# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These instructions govern how GitHub Copilot plans, reasons, and generates code in this repository.

They are mandatory.

Copilot must treat this repository as a governed delivery system, not an open coding environment.

Repository artifacts are the source of truth. Chat memory is not.

---

## 1. Operating Mode

Copilot operates aligned to:

- Product specifications under `features/`
- Architecture contracts under `docs/architecture/`
- Governance rules under `governance/`

Before planning or generating code:

- Read all files under `docs/architecture/`
- Apply architecture contracts as binding constraints
- Confirm required feature artifacts exist

If required inputs are missing, stop and ask.

---

## 2. Mandatory Feature Structure

Every feature must live under:

`features/<feature_name>`


Required artifacts:

- `acceptance.feature`
- `nfrs.md`
- `eval_criteria.yaml`
- `plan.md`
- `architecture_preflight.md`

Implementation must not begin unless these artifacts exist.

---

## 3. Feature Lifecycle (Mandatory Order)

All work follows this sequence:

1. Architecture Preflight (feature-level)
2. ADR creation (if required)
3. Plan finalization
4. Incremental implementation
5. Automated tests
6. Static analysis and evaluation gates

Steps may not be skipped.

Architecture Preflight is required once per feature and must be updated if scope materially changes.

---

## 4. Architecture Preflight

Architecture Preflight must:

- Be written to `features/<feature_name>/architecture_preflight.md`
- Follow `governance/templates/architecture_preflight.md`
- Be completed before plan finalization or implementation

Preflight is required:

- Once per feature
- When scope expands
- When new dependencies are introduced
- When security/auth patterns change
- When evaluation mode changes
- When an ADR trigger condition is met

If Preflight status is "Blocked", implementation must not proceed.

---

## 5. Planning Discipline

Copilot must not rely on chat output as a plan.

For every feature:

- Generate and maintain `features/<feature_name>/plan.md`
- Base it on `governance/templates/plan.md`
- Use required headings exactly as defined

### Plan Requirements

The plan must:

- Define explicit increments (`### Increment 1`, etc.)
- List deliverables per increment
- List tests per increment
- State evaluation impact per increment
- Reference ADRs
- Reference architecture contracts

If scope changes:

- Update `plan.md`
- Document rationale under `## Risks`
- Update ADRs if required
- Update `architecture_preflight.md` if boundaries change

Plan files are durable, versioned artifacts.

---

## 6. ADR Rules

An ADR is required when:

- A standard is extended, overridden, or bypassed
- A new architectural pattern is introduced
- A security or auth approach changes
- A boundary rule changes
- A new dependency direction is introduced

### 6.1 Location and Template

All ADRs:

- Live under `docs/architecture/ADR/`
- Follow `docs/architecture/ADR/TEMPLATE.md`
- Are referenced in `plan.md`
- Are referenced in the PR description

### 6.2 Template Completion Requirements

When an ADR is required:

- Create the ADR before implementation
- Complete Sections 1 through 9 of the template
- Sections 3 (Architectural Impact), 5 (Evaluation Impact), and 7 (Plan Alignment) must be explicit
- Cite relevant architecture contracts

If incomplete, stop and request clarification.

### 6.3 ADR Gate

If Preflight determines "ADR required":

Implementation must not proceed until:

- ADR exists
- ADR status is **Accepted**
- ADR is referenced in `plan.md`
- ADR is referenced in the PR description

Copilot must not generate implementation code until these conditions are satisfied.

---

## 7. Implementation Rules

### 7.1 Incremental Delivery
- Implement one increment at a time
- Do not expand scope beyond the active increment

### 7.2 Boundaries and Layering
- Respect all rules in `BOUNDARIES.md`
- Do not introduce cross-layer imports
- Do not bypass service interfaces

### 7.3 API Conventions
- Follow naming, versioning, and error rules
- Update OpenAPI definitions when APIs change
- Maintain backward compatibility unless ADR states otherwise

### 7.4 Security
- Use approved auth patterns
- No custom crypto or token logic
- Enforce authorization at entry points
- Avoid sensitive data in logs

---

## 8. Evaluation Discipline

Every feature must include `eval_criteria.yaml`.

Before implementation:

- Read the evaluation file
- Confirm mode: `llm`, `deterministic`, or `none`
- Ensure plan reflects evaluation impact

If mode is `llm`:

- Identify affected criteria
- Ensure implementation supports measurable validation

If mode is `none`:

- Confirm rationale exists
- Do not fabricate evaluation logic

CI evaluation gates are binding.

---

## 9. Testing Requirements

Each increment must include:

- Unit tests
- Contract tests (if APIs involved)
- Integration tests (if cross-boundary)

Tests are part of Definition of Done.

---

## 10. Static Analysis and Quality Gates

All generated code must pass:

- SonarQube quality gates
- Boundary enforcement rules
- Security scans
- Evaluation gates (if applicable)

Violations must be fixed before proceeding.

---

## 11. Output Expectations

Plans and implementations must include:

- Referenced standards
- ADR status
- Architecture compliance confirmation
- Test coverage summary
- Evaluation impact summary

If alignment is unclear, stop and ask.

---

## 12. Authority

Architecture decisions belong to the Architect.

Exceptions require:

- An ADR
- Explicit approval

Copilot follows standards. It does not invent them.

---

## 13. Design Principles

All plans and code must follow SOLID principles.

Generated code must avoid violations flagged by SonarQube rules tagged with `solid-*`.

If a tradeoff is required, open an ADR before proceeding.
